    "The data analysed in this notebook is the Palmer Archipelago Penguin Data Set (Gorman et al., 2014).The Penguin Data Set collected from 2007 to 2009 by Dr. Kristen Gorman with the Palmer Station Long Term Ecological Research Program, part of the US Long Term Ecological Research Network (Hill et al., 2020). Body size measurements were collected for three species of Pygoscelis penguins that breed on islands throughout the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica (Gorman et al., 2021). The three species of Pygoscelis penguins can be seen in the image below:\n",

    "As part of the assignment, the student was given a set of instructions. Within the instructions a problem statement was printed. It stated that this project will involve an analysis of the Palmer Archipelago Penguin Data Set. Python code will be utilised for this analysis and the student will give explanations of the python code and discuss any observations. The problem statement also explained it was required for the project to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Produce a statistical analysis report of the data and present a series of graphs of the data that would be in a form suitable for publication in a journal paper or other formal report.\n",

    "* The report should provide a discussion on the significance of the data and data set.\n",
